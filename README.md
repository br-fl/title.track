# title.track
JSON files to assist with title cutoffs in WoW Legion

### What we provide
Please make the most of the information available, currently starting as a 'proof of concept' but we are happy for others to use the information we have produced (Although would be nice to see contributions!)

We expect to be providing full ladderboards (but with factions!), list of players by faction, maxed level players by realms and guild by realms once the project is in full swing.

### Current process
1. Scan Auction House and Leaderboards (Incl. PvP) for players (Plus character lists/exports available online)
2. Check each player for Guild and PvP Stats
3. Check each guild for additional players
4. Routinely process PvP players to ensure that they are still 'active'

### Assist us
Please assist us by providing maxed level characters, guilds, and/or character data with pvp rating

This is a very slow process due to API limits, any help would be appreciated
